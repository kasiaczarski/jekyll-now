title: Organizing the Photo Library
---

	One of my first tasks is to organize the photos library. Currently, the OSO’s 422
  photos are not organized in anyway besides filed under ‘casual’, ‘formal’, 
  ‘studio’, ‘touch-up’ on the photographer’s website (which you can find here 
  https://shawnpeters.shootproof.com/gallery/oso2018/). Kate and Angela requested 
  that I make edits to the photos metadata as well as find an app that can make the
  photos more searchable and hold future photographs. 
  
	The first idea I has was to simply use the computer’s operating system to search 
  and organize photos. Kate has requested that the photos be held on an internal 
  drive in the computer and would not need a password to access due to high flip 
  over rate in the office. I think downloading the photos onto the computer would 
  be effective enough. However, there are some problems that may result both major 
  and minor (musical pun intended). If the computer crashes, these photos may 
  disappear. Some inconsistencies can arise since photos would probably have to be 
  uploaded on multiple computers so everyone has access to them. 
  
	If I try to find an application/online uploading source, it would need a password
  to access the photos which is contrary to what Kate has asked for. Another idea 
  is that if the email of the general manager could have access to a drive. 
  However, again, this requires passwords and 
  
	The first step in making the photos searchable is to edit the metadata. To do 
  this properly, I did some research to know exactly what metadata should contain. 
  Metadata means “data that describes other sort of data” (Naryskin, 2017). It can 
  include the lens aperture, the date and time, and more which can be automatically
  updated, or it can be manually edited by adding descriptive words. These 
  descriptive words include the location, event, people, photo genre, year, season,
  and whatever else (Naryskin, 2017). I have 422 photos to do this for and I don’t 
  think there is an easy way to sift through and name them but sitting with a nice
  drink and editing them all. I have been allotted 5 hours for this task, however, I think it 
  may require more.
