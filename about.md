24 years old, undergraduate of Musical Composition and Improvisation from Wilfrid Laurier University, pursuing a Masters of Music and Culture at Carleton University with a specialization in Digital Humanities. I’m currently playing shows that explore electric bass and voice song writing. I’m also always trying to improve my lyricism and musical expression/sound.
